#stLFRsv
## Introuction:
Structure variation(SV) pipeline for stLFR co-barcode reads data.
This tool is applicable to stLFR technology and similar co-barcode data. Currently running on stLFR data, theoretically it is also applicable to other linked read data. You can analyze and test this tools by converting the data to the `read_id#XXX_XXX_XXX` format on read ID(`XXX_XXX_XXX` is the read barcode).

**Share barcode** information is used to detect breakpoint signals of structural variation (SV), such as: equilibrium translocation, inversion, deletion, duplication, and more complex structural breakpoints, which can be combined with CNV results and phase results. The accuracy of the structural variation is limited by the distribution density and length of linked reads on DNA molecules. For example, stLFR kits built with 1.5ng human DNA starting volume(about 30x significant depth) can produce data that can guarantee SV detection accuracy above 20K.

## Directory Structure:

* **bin**: necessary binarys to run the pipeline
* **data**: pre-build control list and black list
* **lib**: necessary libraris used in the pipeline
* **tools**: useful tools for the pipeline
* **src**: all source codes of the pipeline
* **LFR-sv**: main program of the pipeline 
* **run.sh**: example script
* **Readme_CN.pdf**: manual(Chinese version)

**Note**: this pipeline is build by `Perl` and `C++`. For the convenience of using (not need to install Perl and additional packages), the `Perl` scripts are packed into binarys. If you get the pipeline through `git clone`, give executive permission(`chmod +x`) to `LFR-sv bin/*` files or you can download the package form the [release page](https://github.com/BGI-biotools/stLFRsv/releases).
(Of course, you can replace the binarys by *.pl in the src with a little modification in LFR-sv.pl)
